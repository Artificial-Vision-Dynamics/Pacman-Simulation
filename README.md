# Pacman-Simulation
Created a pacman simulation in Python, as a part of Berkeley's University Artificial Intelligence course. Depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, A* search, minimax and expectimax algorithms were implemented.

## Search - Part 1
In this project, Pacman agent finds paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. General search algorithms were built and applied them to Pacman scenarios.

### Algorithms implemented
1. Depth First Search
2. Breadth First Search
3. Uniform Cost Search
4. A* Search

## Muiltiagents - Part 2
In this project, agents for the classic version of Pacman were designed, including ghosts. Along the way, both minimax and expectimax search were implemented. I also experimented with evaluation function design.

### Questions
1. Reflex Agent
2. Minimax
3. Alpha-Beta Pruning
4. Expectimax
5. Evaluation Function
